# Deployment

## Overview

<p align="justify">

To deploy Law Knowledge, **[Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/)** is a recommended platform. AWS is a comprehensive and widely adopted cloud platform, offering over 200 fully featured services from data centers globally. It provides a variety of services including computing power, storage options, and networking capabilities, often under a pay-as-you-go pricing model. AWS services are accessible via the AWS Management Console, which is a web-based interface, command-line tools, or through APIs and SDKs. AWS supports a broad set of applications and workloads, providing flexibility and scalability to users, making it a suitable choice for a range of cloud computing needs.
