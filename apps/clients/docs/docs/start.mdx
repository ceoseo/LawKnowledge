# Getting Started

<p align="justify">

Welcome to the getting started for Law Knowledge project!

If you are new to the project, this is the place to start. Here you will find the information you need to get up and running with the project quickly. You will also find information about the project's architecture, the technologies used, and the tools that are available to help you develop your application.

If you have any questions, please feel free to ask in the [Telegram](https://t.me/+bz74heXQgBwwOWRl). Our Telegram channel is a place where you can ask questions, share ideas, and collaborate on the project. Connect with users from the community and get help from the project maintainers. Get your questions answered and learn cool new tips and tricks! Watch for notifications of the latest content from Redis and the community. And share your own content with the community.

## üíª Hardware Requirements

<p align="justify">

- **Memory (RAM):** 16GB of RAM is recommended. This amount of RAM is advised to ensure smooth operation when running multiple Docker containers. Running the application with 8GB of RAM may lead to performance issues and resource constraints.

- **Processor (CPU):** A multi-core processor with good performance is recommended, as it will help with running containerized services efficiently.

- **Storage:** Sufficient storage space is required to store code repositories, container images, and application data. It's recommended to have at least 100GB of free disk space.

- **Network:** A stable and high-speed internet connection is beneficial, especially when pulling and pushing container images and collaborating on projects hosted on GitHub.

Having a computer that meets or exceeds these recommended hardware requirements will enhance your development experience and ensure that your Law Knowledge development environment can handle the demands of running containerized services and managing code effectively.

## üòÑ HuggingFace Resources

<p align="justify">

You can download the dataset from the following link:

- [Law Knowledge Data](https://huggingface.co/datasets/foxminchan/law-knowledge): The dataset from [Ph√°p ƒëi·ªÉn](https://phapdien.gov.vn/) and [VƒÉn b·∫£n ph√°p lu·∫≠t](https://vanbanphapluat.co/).
- [Law Knowledge Model](https://huggingface.co/foxminchan/law-knowledge): A fine-tuned model from [PhoBERT](https://huggingface.co/phobert-base-v2).

</p>

## üßë‚Äçüíª Setup

First, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/foxminchan/LawKnowledge
```

Next, navigate to the root directory of the project and install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install --force
```

## üöÄ Running

For the website, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx nx serve website --prod
```

For the API, you can run the following command:

```bash
# For the API Gateway
npx nx serve api-gateway --prod

# For the Auth Service
npx nx serve auth-svc --prod

# For the Law Service
npx nx serve law-svc --prod

# For the Search Service, navigate to the search-svc directory
npx nx build search-svc && cd apps/api/search-svc/search-svc && python main.py

# For the Chat Service, navigate to the chat-svc directory
npx nx build chat-svc && cd apps/api/chat-svc/chat-svc && python main.py
```

To traning the model, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx nx build bert && cd apps/nlp/bert/bert && python main.py
```

To set up the infrastructure, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx nx up pulumi
```

## üß™ Testing

For the website, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx nx test website-e2e
```

For the API, you can run the following command:

```bash
# For the API Gateway
npx nx test api-gateway-e2e

# For the Auth Service
npx nx test auth-svc-e2e

# For the Law Service
npx nx test law-svc-e2e

# For the Search Service
npx nx test search-svc-e2e

# For the Chat Service
npx nx test chat-svc
```

To test the model, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx nx test bert
```

## üß© Other

To run the tooling for processing the dataset, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx nx build processor && cd apps/nlp/processor/processor && python main.py
```

For running documentation, you can run the following command:

```bash
npx nx serve docs
```

Some useful scripts:

```bash
# Navigate to the scripts directory
cd tools/scripts && ls

# + scripts
# +-- build.sh --> Build the project
# +-- clean.sh --> Clean the docker image
# +-- init.sh --> Initialize the project
# +-- prepare.sh --> Prepare the project
# +-- start.sh --> Start the project
# +-- start-o11y.sh --> Start the observability stack
# +-- stop-o11y.sh --> Stop the observability stack

# Run the script
./<script-name>
```
