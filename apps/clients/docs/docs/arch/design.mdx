# Architecture

## Overview

<p align="justify">

In this project, we build a system that can search and answer questions about the code of laws in Vietnam. The system is built with **Microservice Architecture** to ensure the scalability and maintainability of the system. The system consists of 3 main components: **Question Answering**, **Search Engine**, and **Data Crawling**.

We use **GPT** to build the Question Answering component. The Search Engine component is built with **Haystack**. The Data Crawling component is built with **HtmlAgilityPack**.

The following diagram shows the architecture of the system. The system is deployed on **Open Stack**. All components are **open source** and **free**.

## Dataset and Model

<p align="justify">

We use the dataset of the code of laws in Vietnam from the [Phap dien](https://phapdien.gov.vn/) website and [QPPL](https://vbpl.vn/pages/portal.aspx) website. The dataset contains 1,000 articles of the code of laws in Vietnam. We use the [GPT](https://huggingface.co/openai) model to build the Question Answering component.
