# Infrastructure

## Overview

<p align="justify">

The infrastructure of the project is built on the OpenStack platform. OpenStack is a free and open-source software platform for cloud computing, mostly deployed as infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS), whereby virtual servers and other resources are made available to customers. The software platform consists of interrelated components that control diverse, multi-vendor hardware pools of processing, storage, and networking resources throughout a data center. Users either manage it through a web-based dashboard, through command-line tools, or through RESTful web services.

## Components

- **OpenStack Services:**

  - **Nova:** Manages compute instances for Kubernetes nodes.
  - **Neutron:** Provides networking for the Kubernetes cluster.
  - **Cinder:** Offers block storage services.
  - **Keystone:** Handles identity services for authentication and authorization.
  - **Glance:** Manages VM images for Kubernetes nodes.

- **Kubernetes Cluster:**

  - **Master Node:** Oversees the entire Kubernetes cluster.
  - **Worker Nodes:** Host the application services.
  - **Ingress Controller:** Manages external access to the services.
  - **Website**: The front-end user interface.
  - **API Gateway:** Routes API requests to appropriate services.

- **Individual Services:**

  - **Law Service:** Handles law-related functionalities.
  - **Auth Service:** Manages authentication processes.
  - **Search Service:** Provides search capabilities.
  - **Chat Service:** Enables chat functionalities.

- **Interactions:**
  - User requests are received by the Ingress controller.
  - The Ingress controller routes requests to the website or the API Gateway.
  - The API Gateway further routes requests to the respective services like Law, Auth, Search, and Chat services.
  - Kubernetes nodes interact with OpenStack services for resources.
